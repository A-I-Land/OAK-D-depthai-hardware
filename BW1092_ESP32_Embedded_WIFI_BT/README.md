# BW1092: Embedded DepthAI Reference Design with Onboard ESP32 for WiFi and BT


# Overview:

This design is one of two baseboards for the DepthAI: System on Module (SoM) - Embedded Variant ([BW1099EMB](https://shop.luxonis.com/collections/all/products/bw1099emb)).

It is available for purchase [here](https://shop.luxonis.com/collections/all/products/bw1092). For reference design files you should look under DM1092_ESP32_Embedded_WIFI_BT_IMU directory.

To read more on the `why` of this design, see https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-hardware/issues/10 and https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-hardware/issues/9.

This design will serves as a reference for multiple purposes:
 - How to use the BW1099EMB with microcontrollers over SPI
 - How to connect DepthAI as an IoT device to AWS-IoT
 - How to use DepthAI without an OS-capable host processor (e.g. with an embedded microcontroller like the ESP32)
 - How to use DepthAI with WiFi and BT
 - First prototype of DepthAI with an integrated IMU (BNO085)
