# Overview

This folder contains OAK-1 files:

- [3D enclosure files](/Mechanical)
- [3D PCBA files](/3D_Models)
- [Datasheet](/Datasheet)

This model has chip-down design, meaning the **Myriad X** is directly on the PCBA, not on the SOM. This makes the device a lot smaller/lighter, but due to the IP we can't open-source these designs. If you would like to customize OAK-1, we would suggest using [OAK-1-Modular](https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-hardware/tree/master/BK1096_OAK-1_Modular) as the starting point, which is opensource, as it has SOM instead.
