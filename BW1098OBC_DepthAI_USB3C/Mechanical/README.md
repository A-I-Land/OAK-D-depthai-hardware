Below is a quick summary of the mechanical files available for the BW1098OBC.  We will be adding the aluminum case when this design is complete.

And in fact here is the OAK-D with this mount and the above GoPro adapter kit being used to film our OAK-D [KickStarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/opencv/opencv-ai-kit/) interview:
