* Files inside the "FAB_1V0" folder contain the fabrication documents that are intended to be used for sensors with lower core voltage, the regulator is set to 1V0 with populating the 0R resistor in place of R4. IMX*** sensors supported in DepthAI can normally be used with this assembly variant.  
* Files inside the "FAB_1V2" folder contain the fabrication documents that are intended to be used for sensors with lower core voltage, the regulator is set to 1V0 with populating the 0R resistor in place of R5. OV9*82 sensors supported in DepthAI can normally be used with this assembly variant.
