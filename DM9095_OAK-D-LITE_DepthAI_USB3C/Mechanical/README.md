## Mechanical step files for OAK-D-Lite

#### OAK-D-Lite enclosure file

`OAK-D-LITE_enclosure.stp` is the enclosure step file for the OAK-D-Lite.

#### OAK-D-Lite LEGO Adapter

Community memeber Adam M. has designed and open-sourced a [LEGO adapter/holder](https://github.com/muelleradam/OLLA) for the OAK-D-Lite, which will be used for the [OpenCV AI contest](https://opencv.org/opencv-spatial-ai-contest/).
We haven't done any tests on this adapter, so we aren't sure about the effect of heating - as it blocks fins and could potentially melt the plastic.
