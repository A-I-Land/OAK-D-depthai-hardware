# DM9095: OAK-D-Lite

![OAK-D-Lite](https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/hardware/en/latest/_images/oak_d_lite_en.png)

# Overview

This folder contains OAK-D-Lite files:

- [3D enclosure files](/Mechanical)
- [3D PCBA files](/3D_Models)
- [Datasheet](/Datasheet)

This model has chip-down design, meaning the **Myriad X** is directly on the PCBA, not on the SOM. This makes the device a lot smaller/lighter, but due to the IP we can't open-source these designs. If you would like to customize OAK-D-Lite, we would suggest using [OAK-D-Lite DEV](https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-hardware/tree/master/DM1095_OAK-D-LITE-DEV_DepthAI_USB3C) as the starting point, which is opensource, as it has SOM instead.
