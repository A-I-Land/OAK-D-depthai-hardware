# DepthAI Open Source Hardware KiCad Community

An open source, community KiCad folder is also available for sharing KiCad based designs and components. 

## Contents

### Footprints

Contains entire *converted* altium luxonis-depthAI footprint library. Dimensions unconfirmed.

### Lib_Sch

Kicad depthAI schematic symbols. All are correct, some are missing, many have not had their footprint checked and assigned (but all are available in footprints). Still, use KiCad libraries if you have the part - will already have a model and footprint associated. 

### Reference Designs

For KiCad versions of the reference designs provided in altium or their derivatives. Right now just the BW1098OBC

### SoMs

### Note: 

KiCad versions of reference designs, footprint/schematic libraries are still very much in the early stages. Once a few designs are complete and more footprints are confirmed, etc, it will be noted which parts of this directory are complete and may be used for reference while others will be marked WIP. For now assume all subdirectories to be in progress unless otherwise noted but please feel free to fork and add what you can to help out with the depthAI community.
