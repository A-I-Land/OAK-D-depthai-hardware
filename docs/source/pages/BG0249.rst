Overview
********

The BG0249 is a carrier board for the Sunny A12N02A IMX378 camera module, and is designed to be compatible with the :ref:`BW1094 <bw1094>` and 
:ref:`BW1098FFC <bw1098ffc>` baseboards. A 26-pin FFC is used to carry 5V power, 4-lane MIPI, I2C, and other control signals between the BW0249 and 
the controller baseboards.
