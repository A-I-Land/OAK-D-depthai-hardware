Overview
********

The BW0250TG is a carrier board for the Sunny TG161B or AN01V32 OV9282 camera module, and is designed to be compatible with the `BW1094 <https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-hardware/tree/master/BW1094_DepthAI_HAT>`__ and 
`BW1098FFC <https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-hardware/tree/master/BW1098FFC_DepthAI_USB3>`__ baseboards. A 20-pin FFC is used to carry 5V power, 
2-lane MIPI, I2C, and other control signals between the BW0250TG and the controller baseboards. A single BG0250TG is typically paired with another 
to create a stereo camera pair.
