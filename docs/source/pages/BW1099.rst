Overview
********

The OAK-SoM (BW1099) is a System on Module (SoM) designed for integration into top-level system with a need for a low-power,
4 Tera Operation Per Second (TOPS) AI vision system. To be used in industrial automation, robotics and security systems.
The OAK-SoM interfaces with the system through a single 10-gbps-rated 100-pin board-to-board mezzanine connector which carries
all signal I/O as well as 5v input. The on-board SMPS system regulates the 5V input and provides all necessary digital and analog power.
An auxillary power port is offered to interface without connetion to a baseboard.
