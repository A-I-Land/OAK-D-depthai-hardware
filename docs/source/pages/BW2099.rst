Overview
********

The **OAK-SoM-Pro** is a System on Module (SoM) designed for integration into top-level system with a need for a low-power,
4 Tera Operation Per Second (TOPS) AI vision system. To be used in industrial automation, robotics and security systems.
The OAK-SoM-Pro interfaces with the system through two 10-gbps-rated 100-pin board-to-board mezzanine connector which carries
all signal I/O as well as 5v input. The on-board SMPS system regulates the 5V input and provides all necessary digital and analog power.
An auxiliary power port is offered to interface without connection to a baseboard.

Devices that use OAK-SoM-Pro
****************************

All devices that have SoM on-board are also open-source. You could redesign them, for example to change stereo baseline. If you
are interested in integrating DepthAI (via SoM) into your product, see :ref:`documentation here <integrating_depthai_into_products>`.
