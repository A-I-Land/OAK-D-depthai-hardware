Overview
********

The OAK-FFC-pToF is a carrier board for the Sunny MTP006 pTOF camera module, and is designed to be compatible with :ref:`OAK-FFC-3P <dm1090ffc>`
and OAK-FFC-4P. It's currenty in **beta stage** so you have to use a custom version of the depthai library to communicate with this FFC module,
more information below at *Getting started*.

Getting started
***************

To get started with OAK-FFC-pToF, you first need to install the correct version: checkout to branch :code:`tof_rgb_mono` in depthai-python and execute
:code:`python3 examples/install_requirements.py`.
After installing the library, you can run the `cam_test.py <https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-python/blob/tof_rgb_mono/tests/cam_test.py>`__
demo by executing :code:`python3 tests/cam_test.py`.

It shows colorized depth by default, and you can add :code:`-tofcm` argument for the pixels to show a value in centimeters
(capped to 255). This allows you to easily check depth from an OpenCV window, as it's displayed in the bottom-left corner when hovering with the mouse.

The :code:`out` output of the ToF node sends `ImgFrame <https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/api/en/latest/components/messages/img_frame/>`__
message of 224x172 size, and the data type is U16 - depth in millimeters.
