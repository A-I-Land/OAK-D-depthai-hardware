DepthAI *NEW* FFC (DM1090FFC)
=============================

.. image:: /_static/images/DM1090FFC/DM1090FFC_up.jpg

Overview
********

The DM1090FFC baseboard has three FFC interfaces which allow for two 2-lane MIPI camera modules i.e. :ref:`DM0250TG <bg0250tg>` (stereo pair) and one 
:ref:`BG0249 <bg0249>` RGB camera module. There is also a chance to connect three 2-lane MIPI camera modules i.e. DM0250TG if DM0249 RGB camera module is not required.

Please note that only revision R1M1E1 and newer camera modules can be connected to the DM1090FFC. With DM1090FFC we gained support for 22-pin RPi camera 
interface. For that you will need a FFC from Arducam, which converts 26-pin Luxonis camera pinout to 22 pin RPi camera pinout.

Here's a list of :ref:`compatible ArduCam cameras <OAK-FCC compatible cameras>` with the DM1090FFC. Those cameras have a M12 mount, so you can use
different lenses to get **custom FoV** (they have wide and narrow angle M12 lenses).

In addition IMU over SPI support was also added to the DM1090FFC.

Getting started
***************

The DM1090FFC is powered via USB Type-C or from a 5V, 5.5m x 2.5mm barrel jack, and interfaces to a host via USB 3.1 Gen1 Type-C. With cameras and the 
DepthAI SoM, total power consumption usually stays below the 900ma specification of USB 3, but Type-C power of 1.5A or greater is recommended.

Interfacing with the DepthAI SoM is also possible with DM1090FFC connector pads J3, J4, and J5. These pads are designed for the Amphenol/FCI 
20021121-00010T1LF or equivalent. Please refer to the schematics for pinout information.

The reset button resets the Luxonis DepthAI SoM only. The boot button overrides boot mode to USB boot if different boot mode is set in NOR Flash 
and `BW1099EMB <https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-hardware/tree/master/SoMs/BW1099EMB/R1M0E1>`__ SoM is used.

The 5V LED indicates 5V power is present on the DM1090FFC. The PG LED indicates "power good" from the DepthAI SoM. The "RUN" LED indicates that the 
DepthAI SoM is not in reset.

Revision info
*************

USB designs with FFC camera boards contain 3 different iterations, below is a flowchart which tries to explain the design progress flow:

.. note::
  The first two revisions (**BW1092FFC** and **DM1098FFC**) were also named **F1**, and the newest revision (**DM1090FFC**) is named **F2**.
