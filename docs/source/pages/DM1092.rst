Overview
********

This design is one of two baseboards for the OAK-SoM-IoT (`BW1099EMB <https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-hardware/tree/master/SoMs/BW1099EMB/R1M0E1>`__).
If you are **new to OAK IOT devices, you can check** `Getting started with OAK IOT devices <https://docs.luxonis.com/en/latest/pages/tutorials/getting-started-with-iot/>`__ tutorial.
To read more on the why of this design, see `here <https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-hardware/issues/10>`__ and 
`here <https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-hardware/issues/9>`__.

Dimensions and Weight
*********************

* Width: 60 mm
* Height: 45 mm
* Length: 25 mm (including the SoM)
* Weight: 45.5g (total), 20g (PCBA), 25.5g (SoM with heatsink)

Key features
************

This design will serve as a reference for multiple purposes:

* How to use the BW1099EMB with microcontrollers over SPI
* How to connect DepthAI as an IoT device to AWS-IoT
* How to use DepthAI without an OS-capable host processor (e.g. with an embedded microcontroller like the ESP32)
* How to use DepthAI with WiFi and Bluetooth
* Prototype of DepthAI with an integrated IMU

Minimal and maximal perceiving distances of the camera
******************************************************

Minimal depth perceiving distance of the camera depends on mono camera FOV, resolution, baseline and stereo depth mode, more info is available on the `Stereo Depth documentation <https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/api/en/latest/components/nodes/stereo_depth/#min-stereo-depth-distance>`__.

OAK-D-IOT-40 has a baseline of 4cm and by varying the resolution and stereo depth mode, we get the following minimal depth perceiving distances:

- Min distance (800P): ~ 37cm
- Min distance (400P): ~ 19.6cm
- Min distance with extended disparity (800P): ~ 19.6cm
- Min distance with extended disparity (400P): ~ 19.6cm

Maximal perceiving distance for OAK-D-IoT-40: 21 meters

For more information about the maximum distance see the `Stereo Depth documentation <https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/api/en/latest/components/nodes/stereo_depth/#max-stereo-depth-distance>`__.

Getting started
***************

The OAK-D-IoT-40 accepts power input from 5V barrel jack and it can also accept power from USB C connector. Booting can be accomplished from either 
the ESP32 or NOR flash on the :ref:`BW1099EMB <bw1099>`, boot selection is configured on BW1099EMB with BOOT resistors.

* The reset button resets the Luxonis DepthAI :ref:`BW1099EMB <bw1099>` SoM only.
* The 5V LED indicates 5V power is present on the DM1092.
* The PG LED indicates "power good" from the DepthAI :ref:`BW1099EMB <bw1099>` SoM.
* The "RUN" LED indicates that the DepthAI SoM is not reset.
