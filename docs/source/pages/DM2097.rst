Overview
********

The OAK-D CM4 PoE is an upgraded version of :ref:`OAK-D-CM4`, as PoE is used both for power delivery and communication (for RPi CM4),
plus in comes in a IP67 rated enclosure. The enclosure is about the size as the :ref:`OAK-D-POE`.
The color camera is also close to the right camera, so RGB-depth alignment isn't needed in most cases,
which reduces system load.
