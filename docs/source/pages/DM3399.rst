Overview
********

**OAK-SoM-Max** has on-board :ref:`Keem Bay VPU <OAK Series 3>`, which has **much greater AI performance** compared to Myriad X,
and **quadcore ARM CPU**. The OAK-SoM-Max is a System on Module (SoM) designed for integration into top-level system with
a need for a low-power, high performance, real-time AI and depth perception.

The OAK-SoM-Max interfaces with the system through three 10-gbps-rated 100-pin board-to-board mezzanine connector which
carries all signal I/O as well as 5v input. The on-board SMPS system regulates the 5V input and provides all necessary
