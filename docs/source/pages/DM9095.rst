OAK-D-Lite
==========

OAK-D-Lite takes the affordability idea and pushes it one step forward. By having the same SpatialAI functionality as OAK-D with a smaller weight and 
form factor, it gives you the opportunity to create all sorts of projects.

It is meant to be used by anyone, anywhere. The Swiss Army Knife of Computer Vision.

OAK-D vs OAK-D-Lite
*******************

OAK-D-Lite is smaller, ligher and uses less power; compared to OAK-D. The main differences are:

- Mono cameras have lower resolution (640x480 instead of 1280x800)
- There (most likely) won't be an IMU (Inertial measurement unit) on the OAK-D-Lite. Those devices increased in both affordability and availability
- There is no power jack, as most users just used the USB-C for power delivery.

Additionally, the more technical differences are the following:

- Myriad X VPU is used directly on the PCB (instead of connecting the SoM to the baseboard - like it is done on OAK-D)
- In collaboration with ArduCam, we developed custom camera sensor connectors, which are shorter and take up less space

Fixed-focus vs Auto-focus
*************************

When ordering OAK-D-Lite, you can select whether you want :code:`Fixed-focus` or :code:`Auto-focus` on the 
color camera, with the **default** option being :code:`Either works for me` (in case any of those options meet
your needs). Note, this **does not apply to the mono cameras**, as they are already fixed-focus
(stereo pairs fundamentally need to be fixed-focus). The main difference between those 2 modes is
the minimal focus distance:

- Auto-focus can clearly focus objects as close as 8cm, while also being able to focus objects at distance.
- Fixed-focus has a much further-out minimum focus distance.

Specifically, from our tests we deduced that fixed-focus color camera was **sharp after about 50cm** and 
**blurry at about 30cm**. In between those distances, some pictures were blurry, some not, therefore we
cannot state the exact cutoff. For referece, here are 2 images shot at 30cm.

Fixed-focus (blurry):

Auto-focus (sharp):

You can choose which mode you want, based on your needs:

- Need for short focus distance (less than 50cm): auto-focus color camera
- Need to operate in high-vibration environments: fixed-focus color camera.

Dimensions and Weight
*********************

* Width: 91 mm
* Height: 28 mm
* Length: 17.5 mm
* Baseline: 75 mm
* Weight: 61 g

Minimal and maximal perceiving distances of the camera
******************************************************

Minimal depth perceiving distance of the camera depends on mono camera FOV, resolution, baseline and stereo depth mode, more info is available on the `Stereo Depth documentation <https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/api/en/latest/components/nodes/stereo_depth/#min-stereo-depth-distance>`__.

OAK-D-Lite has a baseline of 7.5cm and by varying the stereo depth mode, we get the following minimal depth perceiving distances:

- Min distance (480P): ~ 35cm
- Min distance with extended disparity (480P): ~ 19.6cm

Maximal perceiving distance for OAK-D: ~ 19.1 meters

For more information about the maximum distance see the `Stereo Depth documentation <https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/api/en/latest/components/nodes/stereo_depth/#max-stereo-depth-distance>`__.

Power consumption
*****************

* Standby: 0.6 W
* Running depthai_demo.py: 4 W
* Max consumption: 4.5 W

Occasional power spikes of 2W may occur when running videoEncoder and/or Neural Network. OAK-D-Lite can be also powered off of USB3.

Operating temperature
*********************

We have tested OAK-D-Lite with the following command which should inflict the highest consumption:

.. code-block:: bash

    python3 depthai_demo.py -enc color -s color left right depth


and after 90 minutes, we received the following temperatures:

* Enclosure: 56.3 °C
* MyriadX: 73.53 °C

The operating temperature range of the Myriad X VPU (die temperature) is -40 °C to 105 °C. The die temperature can get to about +35°C from the ambient 
temperature. Note that the stable image temperature of the camera sensor is 0 °C to +50 °C (operating temperature -30 °C to +70 °C).
