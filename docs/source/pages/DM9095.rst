OAK-D-Lite
==========

OAK-D-Lite takes the affordability idea and pushes it one step forward. By having the same SpatialAI functionality as OAK-D with a smaller weight and 
form factor, it gives you the opportunity to create all sorts of projects.

It is meant to be used by anyone, anywhere. The Swiss Army Knife of Computer Vision.

Key features
************

* Neural Inference (object detection, image classification, semantic segmentation, pose estimation)
* Object tracking
* 3D Object Tracking (up to 20 objects with unique ID)
* 3D Object Localization
* H.264 & H.265 Encoding (HEVC, 1080P, and 4K Video) - A Pi Zero can record 4K/30 FPS video with this
* Motion Estimation (allows real-time background subtraction)
* Feature Tracking (optical, and visual inertial navigation)
* Corner Detection
* Stereo Depth (including median filtering, tended disparity and subpixel possible for wider dynamic range)
* Warp/Dewarp - support for additional lenses for fish-eye applications
* JPEG Encoding
* MJPEG Encoding for easy web streaming

Dimensions and Weight
*********************

* Width: 91 mm
* Height: 28 mm
* Length: 17.5 mm
* Baseline: 75 mm
* Weight: 61 g

Power consumption
*****************

* Standby: 0.6 W
* Running depthai_demo.py: 4 W
* Max consumption: 4.5 W

Occasional power spikes of 2W may occur when running videoEncoder and/or Neural Network. OAK-D-Lite can be also powered off of USB3.

Operating temperature
*********************

We have tested OAK-D-Lite with the following command which should inflict the highest consumption:

.. code-block:: bash

    python3 depthai_demo.py -enc color -s color left right depth


and after 90 minutes, we received the following temperatures:

* Enclosure: 56.3 °C
* MyriadX: 73.53 °C

The operating temperature range of the Myriad X VPU (die temperature) is -40 °C to 105 °C. The die temperature can get to about +35°C from the ambient 
temperature. Note that the stable image temperature of the camera sensor is 0 °C to +50 °C (operating temperature -30 °C to +70 °C).
