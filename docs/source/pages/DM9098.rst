Overview
********

The OAK-D-Pro is an upgraded version of :ref:`OAK-D`, featuring **IR laser dot projector** (active stereo) and **IR illumination LED** (for
"night vision"). It's also smaller and lighter than the OAK-D.
It's currenty in **beta stage** so you have to use a custom version of the depthai library to communicate with this device,
more information below at *Getting started*.

How it works
************

OAK-D-Pro has **notch IR filters** (940nm) on mono cameras, which allows only visible light and IR light from illumination LED/laser dot
projector to the camera.

**Laser dot projector** projects many small dots in front of the device, which helps with disparity matching, especially for low-visual-interest surfaces
(blank surfaces with little to no texture), such as a wall or floor. Technique that we use is called `ASV <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_stereo_vision#Conventional_active_stereo_vision_(ASV)>`__
- conventional active stereo vision - as stereo matching is performed on device the same way as on OAK-D (passive stereo).

**Blanket IR LED** illumination allows perceiving low-light and no-light environments. You can run your AI/CV processes
on frames that are illuminated by the IR LED. Note that color camera doesn't percieve IR light, so you would need to use mono camera stream
for your AI/CV processes.

Getting started
***************

To get started with OAK-D-Pro, you first need to install the correct version: checkout to branch :code:`oak-d-pro` in `depthai <https://github.com/luxonis/depthai>`__
and execute :code:`python3 install_requirements.py`.
This will install the correct library, so you can execute :code:`depthai_demo.py`. Control panel for configuring IR LED/laser projector should appear,
as shown on screenshots below.

*FOI = Field of illumination*. Also note that in datasheet, HFOI and VFOI are switched, that's because we mount the Belago1.1 rotated as we want
greater horizontal field, to match field of cameras.

Demo
****

As you can see from :code:`color` frame on screenshots, it's pitch dark in the room, so the only light source is the IR illumination LED/dot projector.
