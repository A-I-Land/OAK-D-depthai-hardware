Overview
********

The **OAK-D Pro** is an upgraded version of :ref:`OAK-D`, featuring an **IR laser dot projector** (active stereo) and **IR illumination LED** (for
"night vision"). It's also smaller and lighter than the OAK-D.
It's currently in the **beta stage** so you have to use a custom version of the depthai library to communicate with this device,
more information can be found below at *Getting started*.
