Overview
********

`ArduCam <https://www.arducam.com/product-category/opencv-ai-kit/>`__ has built a series of M12-capable and C/CS-capable camera boards that work with DepthAI
and megaAI. A variety of M12-mount options allow to match lenses in many projects. More about how to get different field of view `here <https://docs.luxonis.com/en/latest/pages/faq/#how-do-i-get-different-field-of-view-or-lenses-for-depthai-and-megaai>`__.
