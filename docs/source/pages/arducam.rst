Overview
********

`ArduCam <https://www.arducam.com/product-category/opencv-ai-kit/>`__ has built a series of M12-capable and C/CS-capable camera boards that work with DepthAI
and megaAI. A variety of M12-mount options allow to match lenses in many projects.

:ref:`FCC <dm1090ffc>` compatible cameras
*****************************************

- `M12-Mount Global Shutter Grayscale OV9282 <https://www.arducam.com/product/arducam-1mp-ov9282-global-shutter-mono-mipi-camera-module-22pin-for-depthai-oak-dm1090ffc/>`__
- `M12-Mount Global Shutter Color OV9782 <https://www.arducam.com/product/arducam-1mp-ov9782-global-shutter-color-mipi-camera-module-22pin-for-depthai-oak-dm1090ffc/>`__

These two cameras are compatible with the :ref:`OAK-FFC-3P <dm1090ffc>`. And since they have **M12 mount**,
you can use a variety of **different lenses** (for **custom FoV**), for example:

- Kit of `10 different M12 lenses <https://www.arducam.com/product/m12-mount-camera-lens-kit-arduino-raspberry-pi/>`__ (for testing purposes),
- `M25156H14 (HFoV: 141°C) <https://www.arducam.com/product/M25156H14/>`__,
- `M40180H10 (HFoV: 100°C) <https://www.arducam.com/product/M40180H10/>`__,
- `M2506ZH04 (HFoV: 33°C) <https://www.arducam.com/product/M2506ZH04/>`__,
- and `others <https://www.arducam.com/product-category/lenses/m12-lens-arducam/>`__
