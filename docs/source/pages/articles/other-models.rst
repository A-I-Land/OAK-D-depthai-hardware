IoT Designs
***********

.. warning::
    OAK IoT series is now **community supported only**, and is **provided as-is**. This means we most likely **won't update it** and **we don't provide support** for it (Discord, forums, email...).

IoT devices have all the same features as USB devices, but additionally feature **on-board flash** (`standalone mode <https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/api/en/latest/tutorials/standalone_mode/>`__)
and on-board **integrated ESP32**, connected to the VPU via SPI (:ref:`more info <Getting started with OAK IoT devices>`).
