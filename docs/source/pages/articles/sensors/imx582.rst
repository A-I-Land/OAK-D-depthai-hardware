Sony's IMX582 is a 48MP (8000x6000) rolling shutter color image sensor. It's the highest resolution sensor that depthai
currnetly supports.

Currently full resolution is center cropped to 5312x6000 (due to current ISP width limit). We are working on
implementing split processing for the full 8000 width.
So current image is much narrower HFOV than the camera actually is (see image below), just because of this current
limitation on linewidth.

To use IMX582, checkout `depthai-python <https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-python>`__ to the ``tmp_imx582_48mp``
branch, and install the library by running ``python3 examples/install_requirements.py``. You can quikcly evaluate
the sensor by running ``python3 tests/cam_test.py -cams rgb,c -cres 13mp``.
