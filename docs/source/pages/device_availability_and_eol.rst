Device availability and EOL
===========================

We **never** EOL (End of Life) products. We have the same culture as
`Mini Circuits <https://www.minicircuits.com/quality/product_change_management.html>`__ - 
who is the top-respected RF component manufacturer in the world, because they never EOL anything.

How this is accomplished
************************

The way Mini Circuits accomplishes this - and we do the same - is to be constantly releasing
new/better products at the same or lower price as previous products. What this means is all 
new customers move to the newest products constantly. And only customers who need **exactly**
the same model (in every way) continue to buy the older models, which allow us to never EOL anything.

Conclusion
**********

This system has worked extremely well for Mini Circuits for decades and so far great for us as well.
This is why we plan to have availability of OAK-D (and all models) indefinitely.
