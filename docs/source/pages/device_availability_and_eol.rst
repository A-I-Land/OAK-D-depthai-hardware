Device availability and EOL
===========================

We **never** EOL (End of Life) products. We have the same culture as
`Mini Circuits <https://www.minicircuits.com/quality/product_change_management.html>`__ - 
who is the top-respected RF component manufacturer in the world, because they never EOL anything.

How this is accomplished
************************

The way Mini Circuits accomplishes this - and we do the same - is to be constantly releasing
new/better products at a more competitive price point as previous products. This will result in current
products being "outdated". However we will still offer them - mostly for companies that base their products
on our products and will continue to buy them.

Wind down of Intel's RealSense
******************************

In August of 2021, Intel decided to "wind down" its RealSense products, which means the development of
product will eventually be stopped. We want to reassure you that this has **no effect on our Movidius
Myriad X (VPU) chip supply**, since that is a different group from RealSense. Furthermore, the Movidius
team has gotten integrated into some huge areas silently, which has resulted in it having guaranteed
production for quite a while. This way, we can guarantee the availability of our devices through 2028 and
likely well past that. More information about this topic

Conclusion
**********

Never "EOL-ing" anything has worked extremely well for Mini Circuits for decades and so far great for
us as well. This is why we plan to have availability of all our devices indefinitely.
