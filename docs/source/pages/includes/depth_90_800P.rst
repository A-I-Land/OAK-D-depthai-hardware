Depth perception
****************

This OAK camera has a baseline of 9.0cm - the distance between left and right stereo camera. Minimal and maximal depth perception
depends on camera FOV, resolution, and baseline - more information `here <https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/api/en/latest/components/nodes/stereo_depth/#min-stereo-depth-distance>`__.

- Min perceivable distance: ~20cm (400P, extended), ~40cm (400P **OR** 800P, extended), ~80cm (800P)
- Max perceivable distance: ~35 meters

**Extended** means that StereoDepth node has **Extended disparity** mode enabled, more information `here <https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/api/en/latest/components/nodes/stereo_depth/#currently-configurable-blocks>`__.
Maximum perceivable distance calculation `here <https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/api/en/latest/components/nodes/stereo_depth/#max-stereo-depth-distance>`__.
