Integrating DepthAI into products
=================================

Difficulity of integrating DepthAI into products
************************************************

When designing our platform from the grounds up, we always thought of user integration and made is as simple
as possible to integrate it into other products. 

What is SoM
***********

SoM stands for System on Module. It is a Printed Circuit Board (PCB) with on-board electronics. All our
SoM devices have the Movidius Myriad X VPU. It is Intel's VPU (Vision Processing Unit) with 16 powerful
SHAVE cores and also features the Neural Compute Engine â€” a dedicated hardware accelerator for deep neural
network inference.
In addition, all our SoM devices have NOR Flash, which can be used as an alternative to the USB boot. 
The idea behind our SoMs is they are minimal devices which can also be used standalone - without host computer,
although USB boot is still available.

We have 3 types of SoM devices:

- `OAK-SoM <https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/hardware/en/latest/pages/BW1099.html>`__
- `OAK-SoM-IoT <https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/hardware/en/latest/pages/BW1099EMB.html>`__
- `OAK-SoM-Pro <https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/hardware/en/latest/pages/BW2099.html>`__

The main difference between them is NOR flash size (OAK-SoM has 16MB, while the other two have 128MB)
and boot modes they support, for example OAK-SoM-Pro also supports SD-card and Ethernet (EEPROM) boot.

Baseboards
**********

Just as our `software <https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-python>`__, our
`hardware <https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-hardware>`__ is opensource too. That way it is not just a black
box, you can see how our devices (PCB) are designed and you can change them however you like. Even high-school
students designed their own baseboard by modifying existing opensource design. Most of complexity is on the SOM,
so the baseboard can be a 2-layer PCB.

Here is an example of a baseboard without the SOM:

And here is the OAK-D-IoT-75, which is a baseboard with on-board cameras and ESP32:

NOR Flash and Powering
**********************

The SoMs have the QSPI NOR Flash, which is capable of quick random access location and is used to
store and run code. This is the key factor to support the standalone use case.

Power consumption can vary depening on the application. A stereo vision application running Mobilenet-SSD
V2 at 30 FPS typically consumes about 2.5 W, but more computationally heavy applications can consume up to 5 W. Most
of this power is consumed by the Intel Movidius Myriad X VPU.

For more information, see the respective datasheet on our GitHub hardawre repository
(`OAK-SoM Datasheet <https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-hardware/blob/master/SoMs/OAK-SoM/OAK-SoM_Datasheet.pdf>`__).
